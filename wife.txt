It's always funny to me when I sometimes catch myself saying things that my parents used to me when I was younger. You know, the kind of stuff that parents usually drill down into your head "to make you a better person"? "Always remember to say thank you and please", or "brush your teeth" or "respect your elders"? Well, this is the story of one of the things my mom used to tell me when I was a teenager and learning by trial and error (mostly by error for sure) about love. You see, I really wish I had great stories about my teenager years and gloat about my many girlfriends I had and how many hearts I broke... but I can't. I was very shy actually, and found it extremely hard to talk to girls, specially with all the acne problem and the oily face and TODO. Worse of all, I always, and I mean ALWAYS fell for the prettiest, most popular girl of the class who happened to know that all the other boys were in love with her and used that knowledge to toy with them and make them do whatever she wanted them to do.
